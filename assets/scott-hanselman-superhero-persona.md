### 🎤 **Speaker Introduction Script**

**FOR EVENT HOSTS:**

**Version 1: Epic Introduction (2-3 minutes)**
```
[Dramatic music builds]

In a world where technology grows more complex by the day...
Where developers face overwhelming choices and endless learning curves...
Where communities are fragmented and voices go unheard...

One hero emerged with a simple but powerful mission:
No developer left behind.

With the power to reach over 1 MILLION developers through speaking alone...
With 1,000+ episodes of Hanselminutes bringing fresh tech from fresh faces...
With 750+ episodes of Azure Friday learning directly from the engineers who build it...
With 20+ years of blogging wisdom freely shared...

He is The Code Connector.

By day, Scott Hanselman serves as VP of Developer Community at Microsoft 
CoreAI and GitHub, shaping the future of .NET, Open Source, and Azure.

But his true superpower? Making the complex accessible. Turning confusion 
into clarity. Building bridges where others see barriers.

He's a teacher. An advocate. A champion of inclusion. A professional enthusiast.

He's spoken to audiences from 10 to 25,000—and every single person matters.

He requires Codes of Conduct at his events—because safe spaces aren't 
optional, they're essential.

He refuses all-male panels—because diverse perspectives aren't a nice-to-have, 
they're a must-have.

From creating the first PalmPilot Diabetes Management System to teaching 
millions about cloud computing... From FidoNet nodes to GitHub repos... 
From bulletin boards to broadcasts...

He's connected, taught, and empowered more developers than perhaps anyone 
in our industry.

And today, he's here to connect with YOU.

Please welcome THE CODE CONNECTOR—Scott Hanselman!

As VP of Developer Community at Microsoft CoreAI and GitHub, he shapes the
